Idea is awesome! I think there could be some ways to explain it a bit better. But only suggestions here.. there could be a slide from the customer perspective where they decide (arbitrage).. what to do with capacity. so Decision A vs. Decision B, etc.. and what the implications are. I think that could explain it nicely for the jury. 
actually could it be automated... like if the rig was connected to IFTTT or something like that. Or is that already the case
Visualization of idea is needed
