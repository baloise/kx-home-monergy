## naming
Cross over of **mon**ey and en**ergy**. 

## Idee: wirtschaftliche Verwendung von dezentral erzeugter, überschüssiger Energie bspw. aus PV-Anlagen
 - Strom-Puffer via bpsw. 
   - Lithium-Ionen Akku + Eigenverbrauch ~30 Cent pro kWh
     - Degeneration 
     - Brandgefahr
     - Eigenverbrauch bspw. Waschmaschine muss getimed werden
   - Netz und Einspeisung nach EEG ~ 6,20 Cent pro kWh -> geht gegen 0
 - Wärme-Puffer bspw. via Heizstab für den Warmwasserspeicher 

## Ziel: entweder-hier > Eigenverbrauch > oder-hier-wollen-wir-hin > Einspeisung

 - Token-Puffer bspw. als ETH; aktuell ~ [110 Cent pro kWh](https://whattomine.com) - (6 x 3070er Nvidia GPU ~800 Watt/h + 200 Watt für System >> 360 MHs) 
  - ggfs. direkt Monetarisierung in Fiat-Währungen: EUR, USD, ...
  - Abwärme als Luft-Heizung nutzen

What are their needs and pains?
Customer Journey Map
```
 - producer of decentralized (renewable) energy e.g. via photovoltaics, wind, etc...
    - segmentation by amount of energy being produced
 - needs & pains
    - increase compensation for unused energy as it is < 10 Rp/kWh and lowering (in Switzerland, Germany, ...)
    - use energy locally - heat with watercooled solutions

## business model / profitability 

```
How do you make money? 
Revenue streams (for which services / product is the customer willing to pay?)
Cost structure
```
 - money making
    - selling miner
    - renting miner
    - paying for kwH more than compensation
 - product / services
    - more compensation
    - using the heat locally
    - decision what to mine / how to store

## value proposition

```
What value or benefit do you serve the customer?
Which customer problems do you solve?
Which customer needs do you satisfy? 
```
 - value: crypto or fiat compensation 
 - increasing ROI of investments in dezentralized energy solutions
 - money, cost-averaging into crypto assets

## strategic fit

```
The strategic fit is clearly explained
Aligns with Baloise focus areas (Core Business, Home, Mobility)
Aligns with Baloise strategic goals (new customers, cash flow, most attractive employer)
```

 - focus area: home
 - goals: new customers (e.g. home owner) + cash flow
