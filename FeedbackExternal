Very interesting idea
Sustainable energy production
How does the splitting work with multi-family house
Electricity to local energy organizations

Do I need new photovoltaic for the product?
How does the billing take place?
Whether I can also control that, today I want to put everything in the mining. Control of the electricity

Duration, how long is it profitable
	1-2 years seems to be short period to return of investment
	Energy production, is more long term oriented 
	It is about a long-term investment. The duration should be longer.
  How long I'm obligated to invest in the product?
